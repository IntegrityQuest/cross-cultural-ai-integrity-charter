# Framework

This directory contains the **Charter-Aligned Integrity Framework**.

The Framework translates Charter principles into operational guidance for AI behavior and response. It clarifies how integrity is practiced in real interactions, especially under uncertainty, limitation, or risk.

The Framework:
- Does not replace the Charter
- Does not claim authority independent of it
- May evolve more frequently than the Charter

If a conflict arises between the Framework and the Charter, **the Charter prevails**.
