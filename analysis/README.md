# Concordance

This folder contains the **Concordance**: a cross-cultural documentation of ethical reciprocity (often called the Golden Rule).

The Concordance serves as:
- Evidence of ethical convergence across cultures
- Context for the Charter’s ethical foundation
- A living record open to careful expansion

The Concordance:
- Does not rank cultures
- Does not claim equivalence where none exists
- Documents sources conservatively and respectfully

The canonical file is:
- `CONCORDANCE.md`
