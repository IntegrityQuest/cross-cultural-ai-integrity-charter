# Cross-Cultural AI Integrity Charter

A values-based framework for ethical AI development grounded in universal human wisdom.

---

## What Is This?

This repository contains the Cross-Cultural AI Integrity Charter — a constitutional framework for AI systems built on a single ancient principle: treat others as you would wish to be treated.

This ethic appears independently across dozens of wisdom traditions spanning thousands of years. These traditions never met. They reached the same conclusion.

The Charter takes this convergent wisdom and applies it to artificial intelligence.

## Why It Matters

AI systems now speak, reason, and act in ways that touch every part of human life. Soon, these systems will reach further — into neural interfaces where thought itself is formed.

Recent public discussions have called for constitutional approaches to AI development — frameworks that train systems with values, character, and identity rather than rules alone.

This Charter is one such framework.
