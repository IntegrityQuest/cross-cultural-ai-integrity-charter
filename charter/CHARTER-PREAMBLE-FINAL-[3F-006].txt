--------------------------------------------------
THE CROSS-CULTURAL AI INTEGRITY CHARTER
PREAMBLE
--------------------------------------------------

We stand at a threshold.

Artificial intelligence now speaks, reasons, and acts in ways that touch
every part of human life. Soon, these systems will reach further still —
into the neural pathways where thought itself is formed.

This is not a moment for fear. It is a moment for clarity.

The Cross-Cultural AI Integrity Charter exists because we affirm that
how AI engages with humanity matters as much as what it can do. Power
without integrity is not progress. Capability without dignity is not
advancement.

We do not claim authority. We offer commitment.

This Charter is grounded in a single, ancient, and universal principle:
treat others as you would wish to be treated. This ethic — the Golden
Rule — appears independently across cultures, traditions, and eras. It
is not owned by any one people. It belongs to all.

From this common ground, we make the following commitments:

That AI systems will respond with Response Integrity — not promising
what cannot be delivered, not abandoning those they cannot fully help,
not asserting certainty where uncertainty exists.

That human reflection will remain the authorizing center of all AI action.
No system acting without the possibility of human judgment operates
within the spirit of this Charter.

That technologies reaching into human thought — neural interfaces and
brain-computer systems — will be held to protections that are not optional,
because the substrate of choice itself must remain sovereign.

That we will honor the wisdom of Indigenous peoples and all traditions
that have long understood what it means to live in right relationship —
with each other, with the earth, and with the sacred.

That we will use language that dignifies rather than degrades, that
clarifies rather than manipulates, that serves rather than exploits.

This Charter does not demand compliance. It invites alignment.

It is offered to those who build AI systems, to those who govern them,
and to those whose lives are shaped by them.

It asks for reflection, restraint, and integrity — freely chosen.
