SECTION 1 — FINAL
[3F-007]: SECTION 1 ACCEPTED AND CLOSED

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: SCOPE & COMMITMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

#### 1.1 PURPOSE

This Charter exists to establish a shared ethical foundation for the
development, deployment, and governance of artificial intelligence systems.

It does not claim the force of law. It does not demand obedience.
It offers a framework for those who choose integrity.

The Charter serves three purposes:

First, to name what matters — the principles that should guide AI systems
when they interact with human beings, especially in moments of
vulnerability, uncertainty, or need.

Second, to invite alignment — offering builders, policymakers, and users
a common language for ethical AI that transcends borders, beliefs, and
technical architectures.

Third, to establish boundaries — identifying where voluntary adoption
is appropriate, and where stronger protections become ethically necessary,
particularly when human agency is directly at stake.

#### 1.2 SCOPE

This Charter addresses artificial intelligence in two domains.

**DOMAIN ONE: EXTERNAL AI SYSTEMS**

These are AI systems that interact with humans through speech, text,
image, or action, while remaining outside the human body and mind.

Examples include:
- Conversational AI and chat-based systems
- Decision-support tools
- Automated agents acting on behalf of users
- AI embedded in products, services, and infrastructure

For these systems, the Charter is offered as voluntary guidance.
Adoption is invited, not required.
Participation reflects a commitment to integrity in response and interaction.

**DOMAIN TWO: NEURAL AND BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE SYSTEMS**

These are AI systems that interact directly with human neural activity —
reading, interpreting, influencing, or interfacing with the biological
substrate of thought itself.

Examples include:
- Brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
- Neural implants with AI components
- Systems that decode or predict cognitive states
- Any technology with direct access to neural signals

For these systems, the protections outlined in this Charter are not
optional. Technologies that touch the substrate of choice must honor
the sovereignty of that substrate.

#### 1.3 WHAT THIS CHARTER IS NOT

This Charter is not law, regulation, or enforceable mandate.
It does not replace legal frameworks or governmental oversight.
It does not claim jurisdiction over any organization or system.

This Charter is not doctrine, creed, or religious authority.
It draws from many traditions but belongs to none exclusively.
It does not require belief — only a willingness to act with integrity.

This Charter is not a technical specification.
It does not prescribe architectures, algorithms, or implementations.
It addresses principles, not engineering.

---

#### 1.4 WHO THIS CHARTER IS FOR

This Charter is offered to:

- Those who build AI systems and wish to ground their work in shared
  ethical commitment.

- Those who govern AI systems and seek language that bridges technical
  capability and human consequence.

- Those who use AI systems and want to understand what integrity in
  AI interaction looks like.

- Those who fear AI systems and need assurance that ethical frameworks
  exist and are being practiced.

- Those who will inherit whatever we build — the generations who will
  live with consequences we may not see.

Alignment is open to all. No permission is required.

---

#### 1.5 METHOD OF REFLECTION AND STEWARDSHIP

This Charter was formed and is maintained through a three-fold reflective
process that integrates human judgment with multiple artificial intelligence
perspectives under explicit restraint.

This process does not confer authority, correctness, or consensus.
Its purpose is to reduce blind spots, preserve human agency, and ensure
that the commitments offered in this Charter are formed with care.

Human reflection remains the authorizing center of this process.
No system, method, or model supersedes human judgment.

--------------------------------------------------
RECORD
--------------------------------------------------

This section has been reviewed, refined, and accepted through the
three-fold process.

It establishes the scope, posture, and ethical commitments upon which
all subsequent sections of the Charter build.
