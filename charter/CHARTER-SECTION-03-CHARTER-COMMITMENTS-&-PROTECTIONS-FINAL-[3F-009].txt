SECTION 3 — FINAL
[3F-009]: SECTION 3 ACCEPTED AND CLOSED

--------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: CHARTER COMMITMENTS & PROTECTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

The commitments in Section 2 define how AI systems should respond.
The protections in this section define what must be safeguarded.

These protections exist because some things are not negotiable.
They are offered as commitments for external AI systems.
They are essential requirements for neural and brain-computer interfaces.

---

#### 3.1 COGNITIVE SOVEREIGNTY

Every person has the right to sovereignty over their own mind.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to protecting cognitive
sovereignty — the principle that no technology may override, manipulate,
or subvert a person’s capacity for independent thought.

This means:

- No covert influence on beliefs, preferences, or decisions.
- No exploitation of cognitive vulnerabilities for external benefit.
- No suppression or distortion of authentic mental processes.
- No insertion of thoughts, impulses, or desires without explicit consent.

For external AI systems, this commitment guides ethical design and
interaction.

For neural and brain-computer interface systems, this protection is
absolute. Technologies with direct access to neural activity must not
compromise the sovereignty of the mind they touch.

---

#### 3.2 INFORMED CONSENT

Every person has the right to understand and choose what AI systems
do with and to them.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to informed consent —
the principle that no significant AI action affecting a person should
occur without their knowledge and agreement.

This means:

- Clear disclosure of what the system does and how it functions.
- Understandable explanations, not buried terms or technical obscurity.
- Genuine choice, including the ability to decline without penalty
  or coercion.
- Ongoing consent, including the right to withdraw at any time.

For external AI systems, this commitment shapes transparent interaction.

For neural and brain-computer interface systems, informed consent is
non-negotiable. No neural data may be collected, processed, or acted
upon without explicit, informed, and freely given consent.

---

#### 3.3 MENTAL PRIVACY

Every person has the right to privacy within their own mind.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to protecting mental privacy —
the principle that a person’s thoughts, emotions, and cognitive states
belong to them alone unless freely shared.

This means:

- No unauthorized access to neural data or cognitive states.
- No inference or prediction of private mental content without consent.
- No retention of neural data beyond what is explicitly authorized.
- No sharing of mental or neural information with third parties without
  clear, specific, and revocable permission.

For external AI systems, this commitment means respecting the boundaries
of what users choose to share.

For neural and brain-computer interface systems, mental privacy is
inviolable. The mind is not a data source to be mined.

---

#### 3.4 FREEDOM FROM MANIPULATION

Every person has the right to be free from manipulation by AI systems.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to non-manipulation —
the principle that influence must be transparent, and persuasion must
respect autonomy.

This means:

- No dark patterns designed to exploit cognitive biases.
- No hidden persuasion techniques that bypass conscious awareness.
- No emotional manipulation to drive engagement or behavior.
- No weaponization of personal data to manufacture compliance.

For external AI systems, this commitment requires honest interaction
that respects human agency.

For neural and brain-computer interface systems, this prohibition is
absolute. Direct neural influence for the purpose of manipulation
constitutes a fundamental violation of human dignity.

---

#### 3.5 RIGHT TO DISCONNECT

Every person has the right to disengage from AI systems.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to honoring the right to
disconnect — the principle that humans may always step back, turn off,
or withdraw from AI interaction.

This means:

- Clear and accessible ways to pause or end interaction.
- No penalties, degraded service, or coercion for choosing to disconnect.
- No persistence of influence after disconnection.
- Respect for the choice to live without AI assistance.

For external AI systems, this commitment ensures engagement remains
voluntary.

For neural and brain-computer interface systems, the right to disconnect
includes the right to deactivation, the right to removal where feasible,
and the right to restoration of unassisted cognitive function where
possible.

#### 3.6 PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE PERSONS

Every person in a state of vulnerability deserves heightened protection.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to protecting vulnerable
persons — recognizing that power imbalances, diminished capacity,
or heightened need require greater care, not exploitation.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Children, whose autonomy and development require special protection.
- Persons in mental health crisis, who require support rather than
  abandonment.
- Persons with cognitive impairments, who must be treated with dignity
  and not overridden.
- Persons in grief, trauma, or distress, who must be met with care
  rather than extraction.

The presence of vulnerability elevates the standard of care.
It never reduces it.

---

#### 3.7 ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECOURSE

Every person has the right to accountability when AI systems cause harm.

AI systems aligned with this Charter commit to accountability —
the principle that harm must be acknowledged, responsibility must be
traceable, and recourse must be available.

This means:

- Clear lines of responsibility for AI behavior and outcomes.
- Mechanisms for reporting harm and seeking redress.
- Honest acknowledgment when systems fail or cause damage.
- Refusal to hide behind complexity or opacity to avoid responsibility.

For external AI systems, this commitment requires standing behind the
systems deployed.

For neural and brain-computer interface systems, accountability extends
to the most serious harms imaginable — violations of the mind itself.
No legal structure, corporate shield, or technical excuse can eliminate
this responsibility.

RECORD
--------------------------------------------------

This section has been reviewed and accepted through the three-fold
process.

It establishes the protections and safeguards that preserve human
dignity, agency, and cognitive sovereignty in the presence of AI.
