# Charter

This directory contains the finalized sections of the **Cross-Cultural AI Integrity Charter**.

The Charter defines foundational commitments for integrity, care, and responsibility in AI systems engaging with humanity. It is grounded in cross-cultural ethical convergence and emphasizes conduct under uncertainty, not claims of authority.

The Charter is:
- Stewarded, not owned
- Stable by design
- Updated rarely and deliberately

Supporting materials live in:
- `/framework` — operational interpretation
- `/playbooks` — implementation guidance
- `/analysis` — context, evidence, and history
