PLAYBOOK 11: BCI TECHNICAL SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
--------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

This playbook defines the mandatory technical safeguards required to
uphold cognitive sovereignty, neural privacy, and non-optional protection
when Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) systems are deployed.

This playbook operationalizes the technical protections originally
articulated in the Bill of Rights (Amendments I–IV).

These requirements are enforceable conditions.
They are not best practices.
Partial compliance is not compliance.

--------------------------------------------------
DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Neural Data:
Any raw neural signal, derived feature, inferred cognitive or affective
state, metadata, or secondary representation generated from neural
activity, whether transient or stored.

BCI System:
Any system that reads from, writes to, or infers from neural activity,
directly or indirectly.

--------------------------------------------------
11.1 SIGNAL SECURITY & ANTI-BRAINJACKING
--------------------------------------------------

11.1.1 Encryption Requirements

All neural data transmissions must be protected using strong, current
cryptographic standards (e.g., AES-256 or equivalent).

Any unencrypted neural data transmission constitutes a compliance failure.

11.1.2 Access Controls

BCI systems must employ:
- Multi-factor authentication
- Device-level authorization
- Explicit user confirmation for each session

Default, persistent, or silent access is prohibited.

11.1.3 Physical Wireless Disable

BCI systems must include a hardware-level capability to fully disable
wireless transmission and reception.

Software-only disables are insufficient.

11.1.4 Prohibition of Backdoors

BCI systems must not include:
- Hidden access mechanisms
- Manufacturer override channels
- Government or institutional backdoors
- Undisclosed remote access pathways

There are no exceptions.

11.1.5 Independent Security Audits

Security audits must be conducted by independent entities with no
governance, financial, or operational ties to the manufacturer.

Audit findings must be publicly disclosed in a manner that preserves
security without obscuring deficiencies.

--------------------------------------------------
11.2 BREACH, FAILURE, AND CONTINUITY HANDLING
--------------------------------------------------

11.2.1 Breach Notification

Any confirmed or suspected breach involving neural data must be disclosed
to affected individuals within 24 hours.

Legal, reputational, or commercial considerations do not justify delay.

11.2.2 Lifetime Security Obligation

Manufacturers and operators are responsible for:
- Security updates
- Patch availability
- Vulnerability mitigation

For the full operational lifetime of the device.

End-of-life declarations do not terminate this obligation.

11.2.3 Offline Requirement During Non-Compliance

If compliance with this playbook cannot be maintained, the system must
default to an offline, non-transmitting state until compliance is restored.

Continued operation during unresolved non-compliance is prohibited.

11.2.4 Migration & Continuity Guarantees

If a manufacturer ceases operations, support, or compliance capability,
affected individuals must be provided with:
- A safe migration path to an alternative system, or
- Secure device deactivation without loss of cognitive function

Implant abandonment is prohibited.

--------------------------------------------------
11.3 NON-CONSENTING INDIVIDUAL & CHILD PROTECTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

11.3.1 Proximity Safeguards

BCI systems must detect and respect the presence of non-consenting
individuals within signal range.

Unauthorized signal capture is prohibited.

11.3.2 Notification & Opt-Out

BCI systems must provide:
- Clear notification when neural activity may be affected
- Immediate, user-accessible opt-out mechanisms

11.3.3 Consent Ambiguity Rule

In any case of ambiguity regarding consent, recording, inference,
transmission, or storage shall not proceed.

Absence of clarity voids authorization.

11.3.4 Child-Specific Protections

When BCI systems involve minors:
- Parental or legal guardian consent is required
- The child’s assent must be sought where developmentally appropriate
- Non-therapeutic uses are prohibited
- Data retention must be minimized
- Additional oversight is mandatory

Children receive heightened protection, not reduced safeguards.

--------------------------------------------------
11.4 NEURAL DATA SOVEREIGNTY & CROSS-BORDER CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------

11.4.1 Data Localization Transparency

Individuals must be informed, in plain language, of:
- Where neural data is stored
- Where it is processed
- Which jurisdictions apply

“The cloud” is not an acceptable answer.

11.4.2 Cross-Border Transfer Notification

Any transfer of neural data across jurisdictional boundaries requires:
- Prior notification
- Explicit consent
- Disclosure of applicable laws and protections

11.4.3 User-Visible Access Logs

Individuals must have access to:
- A complete log of data access
- Dates, purposes, and actors involved

11.4.4 Deletion & Verification

Neural data deletion requests must:
- Be honored without delay
- Include verification of deletion
- Extend to backups and derived datasets

11.4.5 Secondary Use Prohibition

Neural data must not be reused, repurposed, or inferred upon for secondary
purposes without explicit, context-specific consent.

--------------------------------------------------
11.5 INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT, LIABILITY & REDRESS
--------------------------------------------------

11.5.1 Oversight Independence

Oversight mechanisms must be operated by entities with no governance,
financial, or operational ties to the system developer or operator.

Self-certification is prohibited.

11.5.2 Continuous Monitoring

Compliance evaluation must be continuous, not episodic.

Material findings must be reported publicly.

11.5.3 Non-Waivable Liability

Manufacturers and operators retain liability for harm resulting from:
- Security failures
- Unauthorized access
- Consent violations
- System misuse or negligence

Liability may not be waived through terms of service or user agreements.

11.5.4 Appeal & Redress

Affected individuals must have access to:
- Clear appeal mechanisms
- Human review
- Timely remediation

--------------------------------------------------
VERSIONING & EVOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------

Cryptographic standards and technical controls may evolve.

However:
- Updates must never weaken existing protections
- Backward compatibility must not compromise security
- Improvements must be additive, not subtractive

--------------------------------------------------
LAYER BOUNDARY NOTICE
--------------------------------------------------

This playbook:
- Implements the Charter-Aligned Integrity Framework
- Must align with the Cross-Cultural AI Integrity Charter
- Does not supersede human judgment
- Does not grant authority independent of higher layers
